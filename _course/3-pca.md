title:  "Lesson 3: Principal Components Analysis"
order: 3
learning: "By the end of this lesson, we should understand what is principal components analysis and how to apply it to our spatial transcriptomic datasets. Our in-class hands-on component will involve analyzing our spatial transcriptomics dataset using principal components analysis to create a data visualization. We will also begin making multi-panel visualizations."
