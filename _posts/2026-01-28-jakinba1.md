### 1. What data types are you visualizing?
This visualization comprises categorical data for the gene marker and quantitative data for the expression values.

### 2. What data encodings (geometric primitives and visual channels) are you using to visualize these data types?
I am using the point geometric primitive, as well as, color(saturation), x-position, y-position, shape to highlight the expression of the biomarker across the tissue.

### 3. What about the data are you trying to make salient through this data visualization? 
I am plotting the expression of the 'Lcn2' gene, a marker for kidney injury, and I am highlighting the particular spots where the expression of 'Lcn2' was observed.

### 4. What Gestalt principles or knowledge about perceptiveness of visual encodings are you using to accomplish this?
I am using the Gestalt principle of similarity.

### 5. Code 

```r
# set working directory and read in data
setwd("C:/Users/John-Paul/Documents/Doctoral_Doctor/PhD/LEARN/Gene_Data_Viz/genomic-data-visualization-2026")
data <- read.csv(gzfile("data/Visium-IRI-ShamR_matrix.csv.gz"))

# check for specific genes (markers of kidney injury)
"Lcn2" %in% colnames(data)
"Havcr1" %in% colnames(data)

# visualize spatial positions of kidney injury markers
df <- data.frame(x= data$x, y=data$y, Lcn2 = data$Lcn2, Havcr1 = data$Havcr1)
head(df)
library(ggplot2)
df$Lcn2_expressed <- ifelse(df$Lcn2 > 0, "Expressed", "Not Expressed")
ggplot(df, aes(x = x, y = y, color = Lcn2, shape = Lcn2_expressed)) +
  geom_point(size = 2) +
  scale_shape_manual(values = c("Expressed" = 16, "Not Expressed" = 1)) +
  labs(shape = "Lcn2 Expression", title = "Spatial Distribution of Lcn2 Expression") +
  coord_fixed() +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(legend.text = element_text(size = 14), legend.title = element_text(size = 16))

```

(AI prompts: I initially had the code: ggplot(df, aes(x=x, y=y, col=Lcn2)) + geom_point() + scale_color_viridis_c() but used generative AI prompts to enhance the visibility of the differential expression.)
